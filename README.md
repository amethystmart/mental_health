# mental_health
Here is my mental health story for my Data Studio class. I chose to focus on stigma, and how it has affected the mental health visibility movement in the United States.
I cleaned up my data and analysed in pandas, and also got important factors in my story like the average and such. I made some choices when cleaning the data, like pulling out the countries with null values. I also struggled to get it to look right in datawrapper, and after looking around online, figured out that an index would help the visualization, and behold, it did!
