# mental_health
Here is my mental health story for my Data Studio class. I chose to focus on stigma, and how it has affected the mental health visibility movement in the United States.
I cleaned up my data and analysed in pandas, and also got important factors in my story like the average and such. I made some choices when cleaning the data, like pulling out the countries with null values. I also struggled to get it to look right in datawrapper, and after looking around online, figured out that an index would help the visualization, and behold, it did! The title is Stigma's Effect on the U.S. Mental Health Crisis. At first, I aimed to see if I could find data on triggers, but spoke with an expert from an national anxiety association who told me data on mental health issues like anxiety don't really work like that. So I turned my attention elsewhere, and actually found a more interesting data set in my opinion. I found a huge gap in comfortability talking about it in the US versus knowing someone who has depression/anxiety. 
I felt pretty accomplished with my scatterplots but would've liked to know other ways to express the data I was trying to show.
